# Julia Molecular Dynamics Simulator

This is a molecular dynamics simulation package written by Julia and at present it is in intensivly development by me.

Currently, it only supports several force fields and serial computing, in the near future, it will be extended to more force fields and multi-threading computing taking advantages of julia parallelling computing.
